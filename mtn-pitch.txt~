Every year, over 2 million students sit the WASSCE exam across West Africa. 
Every year, countless numbers of students fail various subjects and have to do remedials. 
Some study very hard but knowing without where their weak points are, their efforts often lead to failure.
This is where 2B comes in.
Named after the standard pencil for the WASSCE exams, 2B is a personalized test preparation app that helps students
ace the WASSCE exams through topical practice, performance tracking, and simulated exam environments using real
WASSCE questions.
2B also provides exam tips and relevant information that you need to crush any WASSCE paper.
Where the real magic happens is with the progress tracker. 2B shows your progress across various topics indicating which
ones you have mastered and which you need to work more on. This allows you to focus your energy on that subject/topic 
that is giving you trouble and know when you are adequately prepared to ace it.
2B also simulates exam conditions with real exam questions you can expect on your WASSCE exam either by year or by topic.
